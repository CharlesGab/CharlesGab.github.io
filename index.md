### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was my favorite because I was amazed at how the data is 
    stored in the vector and this is what I noticed that folders store 
    multiple types of data inside. I learned vector is very helpful 
    for storing multiple sets of data in the file. 
    I like how we search each of the rows and 
    columns in order we take out the date from the file.

* Lab 6 
    
    Lab 6, part 2 was also my favorite because I like how the code 
    is working with different functions and each function has 
    its behavior or actions. Also how the system works for the BlackJack
    game and its playable for users. The functions are very helpful
    for calculating the amount of points for the game Blackjack.

* Lab 9 

    Lab 9, was interesting because there is a part of the lab where 
    we can detect each index in the text. The Compare code was also 
    an interesting part because I was able to choose what letter in the index. 
    This is very helpful if we want to detect anomalies.
